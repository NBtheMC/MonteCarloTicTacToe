When using the 1 sec as a time constraint, the mcts_vanilla tree size started off around 1100 nodes at the first iteration and continued to increase to about 4000 -9000 nodes when completed. The mcts_modified had a much lower starting point for the nodes which was starting at around 140 nodes and increased to around 1000 nodes. We expected this of our modified because the heuristic that we implemented takes a lot of time and it would not be able to get as many nodes in as vanilla due to this. 
We tested a change in the time limit by lowering it; when we lowered the time limit to 0.1 seconds the results just scaled down for the two bots (vanilla and modified). The vanilla bot went from starting at 1100 nodes to starting around 150 and the modified went from 140 to around 16 nodes.
