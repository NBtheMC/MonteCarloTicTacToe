The heuristic added to rollout was made to predict 3 in a row from the opponent and filling in 3 in a row from the player. Our modified heuristic did not win more games against rollout_bot. It in fact lost more. It won only 35% of the time against it with a tree size of 100. When the tree size was decreased to 200, the win rate dropped to only 17%. This might be due to the fact that even though the rollout is choosing the best action, the UCT does not follow through on that.
